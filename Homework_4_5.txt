A character set is a set of symbols and encodings. A collation is a set of
rules for comparing characters in a character set. Let's make the distinction 
clear with an example of an imaginary character set.

Suppose that we have an alphabet with four letters: 'A', 'B', 'a', 'b'.
We give each letter a number: 'A' = 0, 'B' = 1, 'a' = 2, 'b' = 3. The letter
 'A' is a symbol, the number 0 is the encoding for 'A', and the combination 
of all four letters and their encodings is a character set.

Now, suppose that we want to compare two string values, 'A' and 'B'. 
The simplest way to do this is to look at the encodings: 0 for 'A' and 1 for 'B'. 
Because 0 is less than 1, we say 'A' is less than 'B'. Now, what we've just done
is apply a collation to our character set. The collation is a set of rules (only 
one rule in this case): "compare the encodings." We call this simplest of all 
possible collations a binary collation.

But what if we want to say that the lowercase and uppercase letters are equivalent? 
Then we would have at least two rules: (1) treat the lowercase letters 'a' and 'b' 
as equivalent to 'A' and 'B'; (2) then compare the encodings. We call this a case-
insensitive collation. It's a little more complex than a binary collation.

In real life, most character sets have many characters: not just 'A' and 'B' but whole 
alphabets, sometimes multiple alphabets or eastern writing systems with thousands of 
characters, along with many special symbols and punctuation marks. Also in real life, 
most collations have many rules: not just case insensitivity but also accent insensitivity 
(an "accent" is a mark attached to a character as in German 'ö') and multiple-character 
mappings (such as the rule that 'ö' = 'OE' in one of the two German collations).
